# hsmodels

hsmodels is a Python module that facilitates working with HydroShare resource and content type metadata in an object oriented way. This library uses [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to represent HydroShare resource and content type metadata as objects that can be manipulated in code. hsmodels enables parsing and validation of HydroShare's resource metadata to enable users of HydroShare's Python client to easily interact with and manipulate metadata for HydroShare resources and content within resources.
